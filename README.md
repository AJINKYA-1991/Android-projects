PROJECT 1
I developed an android mobile application for  game searching.This app uses the gamesdb.net api to display the set of games.The  GetGame API (http://wiki.thegamesdb.net/index.php/GetGame) is used to retrieve the Game details.The app also provides the feature of displaying the trailer for a particular game.


PROJECT 2
Developed an android mobile application that takes city and country names as input and display 5day/3hourly weather forecast information for the entered city. This app uses Sqlite database to store the previously searched cities and the user can even mark certain cities to his/her favourites. The app also provides the feature of selecting a temperature unit, thus converting all the data into that particular unit (Farenheit/Celsius). The information is retrieved by calling and weather-forecast API and parsing that accordingly.
