PROJECT 1
I developed an android mobile application for  game searching.This app uses the gamesdb.net api to display the set of games.The  GetGame API (http://wiki.thegamesdb.net/index.php/GetGame) is used to retrieve the Game details.The app also provides the feature of displaying the trailer for a particular game.
